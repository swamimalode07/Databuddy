description: Work inside the Databuddy monorepo for internal implementation, debugging, review, and refactoring. Use only for repository code changes across dashboard, api, basket, links, docs, uptime, SDK, tracker, auth, RPC, database schema, ClickHouse, or shared packages. Do not use for external SDK, API, CDN, feature flag, or LLM observability integration guidance; use databuddy instead.

# Databuddy Internal

Databuddy is a Bun + Turborepo TypeScript monorepo. Start by locating the user request in one product surface, then trace its shared dependencies before editing.

For **external** integrations (SDK, CDN, public APIs), use the **`databuddy`** skill; this skill is for **this repository**.

## Skill maintenance (required)

When a mistake could have been avoided with better repo context (wrong app, package, port, or pattern), or when the user corrects you or asks you to fix something you got wrong, **update this skill** (`SKILL.md` or `references/codebase-map.md`) in the same turn when practical.

Keep additions **minimal**: one bullet, a new `rg` hint, or a routing note—enough that the next session does not repeat it. If the lesson is for SDK/API customers, add it under `.agents/skills/databuddy/` instead.

## Quick Map

- `apps/dashboard`: Next.js app on port `3000` (per-website **agent** chat: `@ai-sdk/react` `useChat` via `contexts/chat-context.tsx` — not the separate `chat-sdk` package; overlapping sends while streaming are queued client-side to mirror a “queue latest” strategy.)
- `apps/api`: Elysia API on port `3001`
- `apps/basket`: ingest and LLM tracking service, Elysia app on port `4000`
- `apps/docs`: Next.js + Fumadocs docs app on port `3005`
- `apps/links`: redirect/link service
- `apps/uptime`: uptime monitoring service
- `packages/db`: Drizzle Postgres schema, client, and ClickHouse helpers
- `packages/rpc`: shared oRPC router, procedures, auth-aware server context
- `packages/auth`: Better Auth setup, permissions, organization access
- `packages/env`: per-app env schemas
- `packages/shared`: shared types, flags, analytics schemas, utilities
- `packages/sdk`: published analytics SDK for React, Vue, and Node
- `packages/tracker`: internal tracker script build and release package
- `packages/ai`, `packages/notifications`, `packages/cache`, `packages/redis`, `packages/services`, `packages/validation`, `packages/api-keys`: shared infra and domain packages

Read [codebase-map.md](./references/codebase-map.md) when you need deeper routing guidance.

## Workflow

1. Identify the runtime surface first: dashboard UI, API, ingest pipeline, docs site, tracker, or shared package.
2. Read the owning package's `package.json`, entrypoint, and direct dependencies before changing code.
3. If the change crosses app boundaries, trace the contract:
   `dashboard -> apps/dashboard/lib/orpc.ts -> packages/rpc -> apps/api`
4. If the change touches analytics ingestion or LLM observability, trace:
   `packages/sdk` or `packages/tracker` -> `apps/basket` -> `packages/db` / ClickHouse
5. If the change touches auth, org permissions, or session-aware server behavior, inspect `packages/auth` and `packages/rpc` together.
6. Validate with the smallest relevant command instead of running the whole monorepo by default.

## Repo Conventions

- Package manager: `bun`
- Task runner: `turbo`
- Formatting/linting: `bun run format`, `bun run lint`
- Root dev orchestration: `bun run dev`
- Dashboard + API together: `bun run dev:dashboard`
- Tests at root currently target `./apps`: `bun run test`
- Database scripts are routed from root into `packages/db`
- Environment schemas live in `packages/env/src/*.ts`; update the matching app schema when adding env vars
- BullMQ queues use `BULLMQ_REDIS_URL`; generic Redis cache/pubsub code uses `REDIS_URL`.

## Change Routing

### Dashboard work

- Start in `apps/dashboard`
- For dashboard navigation audits, check all route surfaces: `components/layout/navigation/navigation-config.tsx`, `components/ui/command-search.tsx`, and local `PageNavigation` layouts under `app/**/layout.tsx` before calling a page orphaned.
- Custom events UI is shared in `apps/dashboard/components/events/custom-events`; keep many-series legends outside the Recharts plot, use compact controls for property-summary event selection, and avoid separate event-count chip/list sections.
- Insights merged feed (`use-insights-feed`) collapses history + AI by `insightSignalDedupeKey` in `apps/dashboard/lib/insight-signal-key.ts` so the list is one row per signal (latest wins).
- Theme: `apps/dashboard/app/globals.css`. **`--border` is intentionally subtle**; do not crank it darker for “contrast” unless **iza** asks—prefer text tokens or layout for readability.
- Dashboard UI must use `apps/dashboard/components/ds` primitives exactly; feature code must not use raw form/control elements (`button`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`, native dialogs), Base UI/Radix primitives, or ad hoc styled controls directly. If a variant is missing, add or extend the DS component first. For menu-style folder/status/filter/sort/action pickers, use `components/ds/dropdown-menu.tsx`; use `Select` only when the established pattern is explicitly a select/combobox. Read `apps/dashboard/components/ds/README.md` before creating new dashboard UI.
- Flags list rows (`app/(main)/websites/[id]/flags/_components/flags-list.tsx`) are clickable containers with nested controls; mark nested controls with `data-row-interactive="true"` and have the row ignore those targets instead of relying on broad cell-level `stopPropagation`.
- For data loading and mutations, inspect `apps/dashboard/lib/orpc.ts` and the corresponding hooks/components
- Many changes require matching edits in `packages/rpc`

### API and RPC work

- Start in `apps/api/src`
- Shared API contracts and procedure logic live in `packages/rpc`
- Prefer changing shared router logic in `packages/rpc` rather than duplicating validation in the dashboard
- Analytics AI insights: `apps/api/src/routes/insights.ts` — dedupe key is `websiteId|type|direction` (direction from **signed** `changePercent`, not sentiment); within the cooldown window, matching rows are **updated** (same `id`) instead of inserting duplicates. **Do not** show `changePercent` in the UI with sentiment-based sign flips; the stored value is already signed.

### Ingestion and analytics pipeline

- Start in `apps/basket/src`
- Request validation, billing checks, geo/IP parsing, producer logic, and structured errors are important here

## Billing (Autumn)

- `autumn-js` v1.2.2+ — import `autumnHandler` from `autumn-js/fetch` (NOT `autumn-js/elysia`, that export was removed in v1.0)
- For Elysia, mount with `.mount(autumnHandler(...))` — NOT `.use()`
- `identify` callback receives `(request: Request)` directly, not `({ request })`
- Webhook event types: `balances.limit_reached` (replaces old `customer.threshold_reached`), `customer.products.updated`, `balances.usage_alert_triggered`
- `balances.limit_reached` payload is flat: `{ customer_id, feature_id, entity_id?, limit_type }` — no full customer object
- SDK `Customer` type uses camelCase (`balances`, `subscriptions`, `overageAllowed`), but **webhook payloads are snake_case** and use old field names (`features`, `products`, `included_usage`, `overage_allowed`) — do NOT use the SDK `Customer` type for webhooks
- SDK class is `new Autumn()` (reads `AUTUMN_SECRET_KEY` from env); methods use camelCase: `customerId`, `featureId`, `sendEvent`
- `autumn-js` catalog version is in root `package.json` — update it when bumping
- Storage and schema concerns usually continue into `packages/db`
- **evlog → Axiom:** never use top-level `error` as a **string** on `log.error({ ... })` (e.g. process handlers); it overwrites structured `error.message` on the wide event. Use `error_message` instead. Basket/API drains run `normalizeWideEventForAxiom` before ingest; 4xx `EvlogError` rows are emitted as `level: "warn"` with `client_http_error: true` so Axiom “errors” are not inflated by expected client failures.

### Database work

- Postgres schema: `packages/db/src/drizzle/schema.ts`
- Relations: `packages/db/src/drizzle/relations.ts`
- Drizzle client: `packages/db/src/client.ts`
- ClickHouse helpers and schema: `packages/db/src/clickhouse/*`
- After schema changes, use the repo db scripts rather than ad hoc commands

### Auth and permissions

- Core auth setup: `packages/auth/src/auth.ts`
- Client auth entrypoint: `packages/auth/src/client/auth-client.ts`
- Permission helpers often flow through `packages/rpc`

### SDK and tracker work

- Published SDK logic: `packages/sdk/src`
- Browser tracker bundle: `packages/tracker/src`
- If the user reports missing analytics events, inspect both the producer side and `apps/basket`

## Verification

- Use targeted package commands when available, for example:
  - `bun run dev:dashboard`
  - `cd apps/api && bun test`
  - `cd packages/sdk && bun test`
  - `cd packages/tracker && bun run test:unit`
- If verification depends on services like Postgres, Redis, ClickHouse, or Redpanda, say so explicitly.

## Pitfalls

- The `:online` model suffix is a **Perplexity-only** convention (e.g. `perplexity/sonar-pro`). Never add `:online` to non-Perplexity models.
- **Vercel AI Gateway** model IDs in `apps/api/src/ai/config/models.ts` use gateway-style names (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`), not OpenRouter catalog strings.
- **Bun HTTP** default `idleTimeout` is **10 seconds**; agent streams can look idle during slow tools. `apps/api/src/index.ts` exports `idleTimeout` on the server (Bun caps at **255** seconds).
- **AI SDK UI (`useChat`)** does not document automatic HTTP retries on `DefaultChatTransport`—retry UX is **`regenerate()`** + `error` ([chatbot error state](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot#error-state), [error handling](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/error-handling)). `maxRetries` on **`streamText`/`generateText`** is server-side model calls, not the browser chat `fetch`. Mid-stream disconnect: **`resumeStream()`** ([useChat](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat)).
- **`@elysiajs/cors` with `origin: true`** sets `Vary: *`, killing CDN caching. Override with `set.headers.vary = "Origin"` on cacheable public endpoints.
- **`applyAuthWideEvent`** in `apps/api/src/index.ts` runs a session DB lookup on every request including anonymous `/public/` routes. Skip it for public endpoints via URL check in `onBeforeHandle`.
- **Agent SQL security**: Tenant isolation (`client_id`) is enforced programmatically in `validateAgentSQL` + `requiresTenantFilter` from `@databuddy/db`. Never rely solely on system-prompt instructions for data isolation. Every SQL tool entry point (API, RPC, etc.) must use the shared validation from `packages/db/src/clickhouse/sql-validation.ts`.
- **ClickHouse table allowlist**: Agent SQL is restricted to `analytics.*` tables only. `system.*`, `information_schema.*` are blocked. Add new allowed prefixes in `sql-validation.ts` if new databases are added.
- **Flags API local dev** requires `dotenv -e .env` from repo root to pick up `REDIS_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, etc.
- **Node SDK flags**: The export is `createServerFlagsManager` (not `createFlagsManager`). Call `waitForInit()` before use.
- **User-scoped flags**: The public flags API loads user-scoped flags (where `flags.userId` is set) via `getCachedFlagsForUser` and merges them with client/org-scoped flags. Client-scoped cache is shared; user-scoped cache is keyed per `userId`.
- **Detail page stats**: Use compact inline `flex` bars at `min-h-10`/`py-2.5` (40px) — not `<dl>` grids with large padding. Heights must be multiples of 10px to align with sidebar item sizing. Status uses a colored dot + text, not `Badge`.
- **User profile detail**: show web vitals as profile/sidebar context, not inside expanded session event rows.
- **`apps/docs` marketing copy:** Do not explain pages as “keyword-focused,” “programmatic,” “intent,” or “meta” in UI—users care about tasks (compare tools, replace X, migrate). Keep internal SEO rationale out of hero and body copy.
