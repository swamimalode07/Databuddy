# Databuddy

Databuddy is a Bun + Turborepo TypeScript monorepo. Start by locating the user request in one product surface, then trace its shared dependencies before editing.

For **external** integrations (SDK, CDN, public APIs), use the **`databuddy-integration`** skill; this skill is for **this repository**.

## Skill maintenance (required)

When a mistake could have been avoided with better repo context (wrong app, package, port, or pattern), or when the user corrects you or asks you to fix something you got wrong, **update this skill** (`SKILL.md` or `references/codebase-map.md`) in the same turn when practical.

Keep additions **minimal**: one bullet, a new `rg` hint, or a routing note—enough that the next session does not repeat it. If the lesson is for SDK/API customers, add it under `.agents/skills/databuddy-integration/` instead.

## Quick Map

- `apps/dashboard`: Next.js app on port `3000` (per-website **agent** chat: `@ai-sdk/react` `useChat` via `contexts/chat-context.tsx` — not the separate `chat-sdk` package; overlapping sends while streaming are queued client-side to mirror a “queue latest” strategy.)
- `apps/api`: Elysia API on port `3001`
- `apps/basket`: ingest and LLM tracking service, Elysia app on port `4000`
- `apps/docs`: Next.js + Fumadocs docs app on port `3005`
- `apps/links`: redirect/link service
- `apps/uptime`: uptime monitoring service
- `packages/db`: Drizzle Postgres schema, client, and ClickHouse helpers
- `packages/rpc`: shared oRPC router, procedures, auth-aware server context
- `packages/auth`: Better Auth setup, permissions, organization access
- `packages/env`: per-app env schemas
- `packages/shared`: shared types, flags, analytics schemas, utilities
- `packages/sdk`: published analytics SDK for React, Vue, and Node
- `packages/tracker`: internal tracker script build and release package
- `packages/ai`, `packages/notifications`, `packages/cache`, `packages/redis`, `packages/services`, `packages/validation`, `packages/api-keys`: shared infra and domain packages

Read [codebase-map.md](./references/codebase-map.md) when you need deeper routing guidance.

## Workflow

1. Identify the runtime surface first: dashboard UI, API, ingest pipeline, docs site, tracker, or shared package.
2. Read the owning package's `package.json`, entrypoint, and direct dependencies before changing code.
3. If the change crosses app boundaries, trace the contract:
   `dashboard -> apps/dashboard/lib/orpc.ts -> packages/rpc -> apps/api`
4. If the change touches analytics ingestion or LLM observability, trace:
   `packages/sdk` or `packages/tracker` -> `apps/basket` -> `packages/db` / ClickHouse
5. If the change touches auth, org permissions, or session-aware server behavior, inspect `packages/auth` and `packages/rpc` together.
6. Validate with the smallest relevant command instead of running the whole monorepo by default.

## Repo Conventions

- Package manager: `bun`
- Task runner: `turbo`
- Formatting/linting: `bun run format`, `bun run lint`
- Root dev orchestration: `bun run dev`
- Dashboard + API together: `bun run dev:dashboard`
- Tests at root currently target `./apps`: `bun run test`
- Database scripts are routed from root into `packages/db`
- Environment schemas live in `packages/env/src/*.ts`; update the matching app schema when adding env vars

## Change Routing

### Dashboard work

- Start in `apps/dashboard`
- Insights merged feed (`use-insights-feed`) collapses history + AI by `insightSignalDedupeKey` in `apps/dashboard/lib/insight-signal-key.ts` so the list is one row per signal (latest wins).
- Theme: `apps/dashboard/app/globals.css`. **`--border` is intentionally subtle**; do not crank it darker for “contrast” unless **iza** asks—prefer text tokens or layout for readability.
- For data loading and mutations, inspect `apps/dashboard/lib/orpc.ts` and the corresponding hooks/components
- Many changes require matching edits in `packages/rpc`

### API and RPC work

- Start in `apps/api/src`
- Shared API contracts and procedure logic live in `packages/rpc`
- Prefer changing shared router logic in `packages/rpc` rather than duplicating validation in the dashboard
- Analytics AI insights: `apps/api/src/routes/insights.ts` — dedupe key is `websiteId|type|direction` (direction from **signed** `changePercent`, not sentiment); within the cooldown window, matching rows are **updated** (same `id`) instead of inserting duplicates. **Do not** show `changePercent` in the UI with sentiment-based sign flips; the stored value is already signed.

### Ingestion and analytics pipeline

- Start in `apps/basket/src`
- Request validation, billing checks, geo/IP parsing, producer logic, and structured errors are important here
- Storage and schema concerns usually continue into `packages/db`

### Database work

- Postgres schema: `packages/db/src/drizzle/schema.ts`
- Relations: `packages/db/src/drizzle/relations.ts`
- Drizzle client: `packages/db/src/client.ts`
- ClickHouse helpers and schema: `packages/db/src/clickhouse/*`
- After schema changes, use the repo db scripts rather than ad hoc commands

### Auth and permissions

- Core auth setup: `packages/auth/src/auth.ts`
- Client auth entrypoint: `packages/auth/src/client/auth-client.ts`
- Permission helpers often flow through `packages/rpc`

### SDK and tracker work

- Published SDK logic: `packages/sdk/src`
- Browser tracker bundle: `packages/tracker/src`
- If the user reports missing analytics events, inspect both the producer side and `apps/basket`

## Verification

- Use targeted package commands when available, for example:
  - `bun run dev:dashboard`
  - `cd apps/api && bun test`
  - `cd packages/sdk && bun test`
  - `cd packages/tracker && bun run test:unit`
- If verification depends on services like Postgres, Redis, ClickHouse, or Redpanda, say so explicitly.

## Pitfalls

- The `:online` model suffix is a **Perplexity-only** convention (e.g. `perplexity/sonar-pro`). Never add `:online` to non-Perplexity models.
- **Vercel AI Gateway** model IDs in `apps/api/src/ai/config/models.ts` use gateway-style names (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5`), not OpenRouter catalog strings.
- **Bun HTTP** default `idleTimeout` is **10 seconds**; agent streams can look idle during slow tools. `apps/api/src/index.ts` exports `idleTimeout` on the server (Bun caps at **255** seconds).
- **AI SDK UI (`useChat`)** does not document automatic HTTP retries on `DefaultChatTransport`—retry UX is **`regenerate()`** + `error` ([chatbot error state](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot#error-state), [error handling](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/error-handling)). `maxRetries` on **`streamText`/`generateText`** is server-side model calls, not the browser chat `fetch`. Mid-stream disconnect: **`resumeStream()`** ([useChat](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat)).
- **`@elysiajs/cors` with `origin: true`** sets `Vary: *`, killing CDN caching. Override with `set.headers.vary = "Origin"` on cacheable public endpoints.
- **`applyAuthWideEvent`** in `apps/api/src/index.ts` runs a session DB lookup on every request including anonymous `/public/` routes. Skip it for public endpoints via URL check in `onBeforeHandle`.
- **Flags API local dev** requires `dotenv -e .env` from repo root to pick up `REDIS_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, etc.
- **Detail page stats**: Use compact inline `flex` bars at `min-h-10`/`py-2.5` (40px) — not `<dl>` grids with large padding. Heights must be multiples of 10px to align with sidebar item sizing. Status uses a colored dot + text, not `Badge`.

## Search Hints

- Use `rg "createRPCContext|appRouter|sessionProcedure" packages/rpc apps/api`
- Use `rg "NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL|createEnv|shouldSkipValidation" packages/env apps/dashboard`
- Use `rg "clickHouse|ClickHouse|TABLE_NAMES" packages/db apps/basket apps/api`
- Use `rg "betterAuth|drizzleAdapter|organization" packages/auth packages/rpc apps/dashboard`
- Use `rg "trackRoute|basketRouter|llmRouter|structured-errors" apps/basket`
- Use `rg "insightDedupeKey|collapseInsightsBySignal|insightSignalDedupeKey" apps/api apps/dashboard`
