		answer:
			"Lab data (like Lighthouse) runs in a controlled environment. Field data - what Databuddy collects - comes from real users on real devices and connections. Google uses field data for rankings, so field data is what matters.",
	},
	{
		question: "Which percentile does Google use to score my site?",
		answer:
			"Google scores your site at the 75th percentile, meaning 75% of your users need to have a Good experience. Databuddy shows p75 prominently so you always know where you stand.",
	},
	{
		question: "How does Databuddy measure INP?",
		answer:
			"Interaction to Next Paint is captured using the PerformanceObserver API, the same method used by Chrome. It measures responsiveness for all interactions - clicks, taps, and keyboard input.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I see which specific pages are failing?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Vitals are tracked per URL, so you can see exactly which routes have poor LCP, high CLS, or slow INP. No more guessing which page is dragging down your overall score.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is web vitals monitoring included in all plans?",
		answer:
			"Web vitals are collected automatically on every plan - there's nothing to turn on. The free plan includes 7 days of history; paid plans extend that to 30 or 90 days.",
