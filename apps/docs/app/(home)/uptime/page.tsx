			"Within a minute. Checks run as frequently as every 60 seconds, and you get notified the moment something goes wrong - before your customers notice.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can my customers see the status page?",
		answer:
			"Yes. You get a public, branded status page that shows real-time uptime data. Share it with customers so they can check service health themselves instead of filing support tickets.",
	},
	{
		question: "Will I get spammed with alerts?",
		answer:
			"No. Alerts only fire when status actually changes - from up to down, or down to up. You won't get repeated notifications during intermittent issues, just one clear signal when something needs attention.",
	},
	{
		question: "What kind of services can I monitor?",
		answer:
			"Any public website, API, or web service. You can also parse JSON health endpoints to monitor specific fields - useful for services that report their own status.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is uptime monitoring included in all plans?",
		answer:
			"Uptime monitoring is available on every paid plan. The number of monitors and how frequently they run depends on your tier - check the pricing page for the full breakdown.",
