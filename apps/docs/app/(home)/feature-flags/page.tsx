		question: "Will feature flags slow down my app?",
		answer:
			"No. Flags load once and are cached locally, so your users never see a delay. Pages render just as fast with flags as without - there's no visible performance impact.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I roll out a feature to just one team or customer first?",
		answer:
			"Yes. You can release to specific users, entire organizations, or teams before opening it up to everyone. This means you can validate with your biggest customer before a wider launch.",
	},
	{
		question: "What happens if something goes wrong after a release?",
		answer:
			"One click and the feature is off - no deploy, no rollback, no downtime. Your users see the previous experience immediately while you fix the issue.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I run A/B tests to see which version performs better?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Create multiple variants, split traffic by percentage, and each user consistently sees the same version across sessions. You can measure which variant drives better outcomes and scale the winner.",
	},
	{
		question: "Are feature flags included in all plans?",
		answer:
			"Every plan includes feature flags - the free plan gives you 3 flags to start, and paid plans scale from there. No add-ons or hidden costs.",
